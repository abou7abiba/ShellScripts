Starting cluster SingleCluster.
When the BPMConfig command is used to start a deployment environment, it invokes the processes that are used to start the associated clusters. If the command is successful in invoking the processes, it returns a message to report that the command completed successfully. However, to determine whether the cluster members were all started successfully, you need to check the log files of the cluster members. The log files are located in <WAS_HOME>/profiles/logs.
The 'BPMConfig.sh -start -profile BpmDmgrProfile -de De1' command completed successfully.
